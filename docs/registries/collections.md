# Firestore Collections Registry

Every Firestore collection used in this project. For each collection: the producers (code that writes to it), consumers (code that reads from it), the rule covering it, and any composite indexes that back its queries. Mismatched producer/consumer pairs and missing rules/indexes are flagged with ⚠.

Update this file whenever a collection is added, removed, or its schema changes.

## `users`

Practitioner / admin / family user profiles.

**Schema (key fields):** `uid`, `email`, `full_name`, `role`, `profession`, `profession_label`, `license_states[]`, `plan`, `monthly_rate`, `beta`, `status` (`pending_activation` | `active` | `rejected`), `baa_accepted`, `created_at`, `active_at`, `rejected_at`.

**Producers**
- `api/routers/users.py:69` — register (full write)
- `api/routers/users.py:271` — set_user_status (status + timestamp)
- `admin-approvals.html:433` — updateDoc status (legacy client-side path; redundant with API)

**Consumers**
- `dashboard.html:562` — read own profile for status gate
- `admin-approvals.html:335` — list all practitioners (`where role == 'practitioner' orderBy created_at desc`)
- `family.html:524` — read practitioner profile by id
- `api/routers/users.py:241` — read in set_user_status
- `api/routers/auth_verification.py:86` — read for full_name

**Rule:** `firestore.rules` /users — self read/write + admin read/write. ✓

**Indexes:** `users` (role ASC, created_at DESC) for admin-approvals list. ✓

---

## `family_groups`

The top-level family group document. Owned by a practitioner; family members reference it via `family_group_id` claim.

**Schema (key fields):** `name`, `practitioner_id`, `care_level`, `status`, `urgent_flags[]`, `overdue_task_count`, `updated_at`, `created_at`.

**Producers**
- `new-client.html:748` — addDoc on client create
- `client.html:882, 913, 922` — updateDoc (urgent flags, etc.)

**Consumers**
- `dashboard.html:872` — list groups (`where practitioner_id == uid orderBy created_at desc`)
- `client.html:698`, `crisis-card.html:411`, `family.html:402`, `intake.html:454`, `care-plan.html:328`, `medications.html:353` — getDoc by id

**Rule:** `firestore.rules` /family_groups — owner / family-claim / admin. ✓

**Indexes:** `family_groups` (practitioner_id ASC, created_at DESC) for dashboard. ✓

---

## `parents`

Parent records, one per parent within a family group. Top-level, keyed by `family_group_id`.

**Schema (key fields):** `family_group_id`, `practitioner_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `care_level`, `dob`, `state`, `invite_email`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.

**Rule:** `firestore.rules` /parents — `canAccessFamilyData` / `canWriteFamilyData`. ✓

**Indexes:** none needed (no orderBy queries).

**API:** `api/routers/parents.py` writes/reads top-level `parents` filtered by `family_group_id`. CRUD endpoints (create, list, get/patch/delete by id) all enforce ownership of the parent's `family_group`. ✓

---

## `medications`

Top-level medication records keyed by `family_group_id`.

**Schema (key fields):** `family_group_id`, `name`, `dose`, `frequency`, `created_at`.

**API:** `api/routers/medications.py` writes/reads top-level `medications` filtered by `family_group_id` (uses created_at index for list). CRUD endpoints (create, list, get/patch/delete by id) all enforce ownership of the med's `family_group`. ✓

---

**Producers**
- `client.html:960` — addDoc

**Consumers**
- `client.html:701` — list by `family_group_id` orderBy `created_at` desc

**Rule:** `firestore.rules` /session_notes — practitioner who owns the group + admin. No family read. ✓

**Indexes:** `session_notes` (family_group_id ASC, created_at DESC). ✓

**API:** `api/routers/session_notes.py` writes/reads top-level `session_notes` collection with `family_group_id` filtering and ownership checks. Orphan (no client caller — client uses direct Firestore) but schema-correct. ✓

---

## `care_plans`

One care plan per family group. Document id = `family_group_id`.

**Schema (key fields):** `family_group_id`, `practitioner_id`, `sections` (keys: `situation`, `goals`, `interventions`, `family_role`, `barriers`, `next_steps`), `intake_summary?` (short paragraph synthesized from the intake when the plan was AI-drafted), `ai_generated`, `reviewed`, `version`, `review_date?`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.

**Producers**
- `care-plan.html:447, 456` — setDoc (merge)
- `intake.html:563` — setDoc (merge from intake)

**Consumers**
- `care-plan.html:329` — getDoc by family id
- `family.html:405` — getDoc by family id

**Rule:** `firestore.rules` /care_plans — practitioner full access, family read, admin full access. ✓

**Indexes:** none needed (doc-id reads only).

---

## `intake_data`

Practitioner intake form data per family group. Document id = `family_group_id`. Server-owned write path — the API writes this as a side effect of `POST /ai/intake`.

**Schema (key fields):** `family_group_id`, `practitioner_id`, `intake` (nested dict: `client_context`, `current_situation`, `medical_history`, `care_needs`, `goals`), `created_at`, `updated_at`.

**Producers**
- `api/routers/ai.py` `POST /ai/intake` — Admin SDK setDoc (merge) after verifying the caller owns the family_group.

**Consumers**
- `api/routers/ai.py` `POST /ai/intake` — feeds the raw intake into Claude to produce care-plan sections + an intake_summary.
- `care-plan.html` — practitioner/admin only "Intake Responses" collapsible reads the raw nested intake.

**Rule:** `firestore.rules` /intake_data — practitioner-only (no family access). ✓

---

## `crisis_info`

Crisis card data per family group. Document id = `family_group_id`.

**Schema (key fields):** `family_group_id`, crisis fields (contacts, escalation steps — TBD), `created_at`, `updated_at`.

**Producers**
- `crisis-card.html:500` — setDoc (merge)

**Consumers**
- `crisis-card.html:414` — getDoc by family id

**Rule:** `firestore.rules` /crisis_info — practitioner full access, family read (emergency access), admin full access. ✓

---

## `family_messages`

Two-way messaging between a family member and the owning practitioner for a family group.

**Schema (key fields):** `family_group_id`, `from_uid`, `from_email`, `from_name`, `text`, `created_at`, `read` (bool).

**Producers**
- `family.html:646` — addDoc (family-member side)
- `client.html` sendMessage — addDoc (practitioner-side reply)

**Consumers**
- `client.html` Messages tab — `onSnapshot(query(family_messages, where family_group_id == X, orderBy created_at asc))`

**Rule:** `firestore.rules` /family_messages — both practitioner and family member can read/write within their group; only the sender (or admin) can edit/delete. ✓

**Indexes:** `family_messages` (family_group_id ASC, created_at ASC) for the practitioner-side thread query. ✓

**Notes:** the `read` field is written but never updated — the current rule only lets the original sender (or admin) modify a message, so the recipient cannot flip `read` without a field-level rule change. Read-receipts and unread badges are deferred until that rule lands.

---

## `family_invitations`

Pending invitations from practitioner to family-member email.

**Schema (key fields):** `family_group_id`, `invited_email` (lowercased), `invited_relationship`, `expires_at`, `status` (`pending` | `accepted` | `expired` | `revoked`), `invited_by_uid`, `invited_at`, `accepted_at`, `accepted_by_uid`, `revoked_at`.

**Producers**

- `api/routers/family_groups.py` revoke_family_member — Admin SDK update (bypasses rules)
- `api/routers/auth_verification.py` accept_invite — Admin SDK status update (bypasses rules)

**Consumers**
- `api/routers/auth_verification.py` accept_invite — Admin SDK lookup by `invited_email` + `status` (bypasses rules)
- `client.html` subscribeFamilyMembers — practitioner-side `onSnapshot` filtered by `family_group_id` (orderBy `invited_at` desc), renders rows with `status == 'accepted'` for the Family Members tab.

**Rule:** `firestore.rules` /family_invitations — practitioner who owns the family_group can read/write; admin full access; family members never touch directly. ✓

**Indexes:** `family_invitations` (invited_email ASC, status ASC) for accept lookup; (family_group_id ASC, invited_at DESC) for practitioner-side list. ✓

---

## `care_updates`

Practitioner-posted updates broadcast to the family portal.

**Schema (key fields):** `family_group_id`, `author_uid` (practitioner), `body`, `posted_at`, optional attachment refs.

**Producers**
- `client.html` postCareUpdate — addDoc (direct Firestore write)

**Consumers**
- `client.html` loadClient + renderCareUpdates — list ordered by `posted_at desc`
- `family.html` loadData + renderCareUpdates — list ordered by `posted_at desc`

**Rule:** `firestore.rules` /care_updates — practitioner full access for owned group, family read, admin full access. ✓

**Indexes:** `care_updates` (family_group_id ASC, posted_at DESC). ✓

---

**Producers / Consumers**
- `api/routers/auth_verification.py:98, 120, 138` (set / delete / get) — Admin SDK only.

---

## `aiConversations`

AI chat history per user. Currently has a rule but no code path uses it.

**Rule:** ✓ (own-conversation only).

⚠ **Dead code:** no producer or consumer in the codebase. Either remove the rule or wire it up when AI chat ships.
